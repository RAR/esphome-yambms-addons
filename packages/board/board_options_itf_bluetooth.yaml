# | BLE Client Interface                 |
# +--------------------------------------+
# This file configures a BLE client connection to a YamBMS BLE server.
# Include this once per BLE server you want to connect to.
#
# Required substitutions:
#   ble_client_id: Unique ID for this client (e.g., "server1")
#   ble_server_mac: MAC address of the BLE server
#
# Usage:
#   packages:
#     ble_server1:
#       url: ...
#       file: packages/board/board_options_itf_bluetooth.yaml
#       vars:
#         ble_client_id: "server1"
#         ble_server_mac: "48:CA:43:B5:EE:26"
#
#     bms9:
#       url: ...
