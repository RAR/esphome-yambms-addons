# | BLE Server for Ecoworthy SECONDARY BMS   |
# +--------------------------------------+
# This package provides YamBMS sensors for a SECONDARY battery and exposes
# them via BLE GATT server for remote clients.
#
# The primary component must be configured with battery_count >= secondary_battery_number
#
# Required substitutions:
#   bms_id: The YamBMS BMS ID number for this secondary
#   bms_name: Display name for this secondary BMS
#   parent_ecoworthy_bms_id: ID of the parent ecoworthy_bms component (e.g., 'ecoworthy_bms9')
#   secondary_battery_number: The secondary battery number (2, 3, 4, etc.)

substitutions:
  bms_model: "Ecoworthy Secondary"
  bms_protocol: "Multi-node BLE"
  # Secondary batteries can't read config registers - provide defaults
  bms_balance_trigger_voltage: '0.030'
  bms_cell_ovp: '3.650'
  bms_cell_uvp: '2.500'
