# | JK RS485 Sniffer Base for BLE Server |
# +--------------------------------------+
# This package sets up the JK RS485 sniffer component that listens
# to the RS485 bus between the JK display and BMS(es).
#
# Include this package ONCE per RS485 bus, then include
# bms_BLE_JK_RS485_Modbus_sniffer.yaml for each BMS on that bus.
#
# Required substitutions:
#   sniffer_id: ID for the sniffer component (e.g., 'jk_sniffer_1')
#   sniffer_name: Display name for the sniffer
#   sniffer_uart_id: UART ID for the RS485 bus
#   sniffer_protocol: Protocol version (JK02_24S, JK02_32S, JK04)

logger:
  tx_buffer_size: 1024
